Hi!
This is a project in which i have created a library BigInteger ,there is a BigInteger library present in java I have tried to make a similar replica of that ,
a big future scope for this still remaining is operations on negative(-ve) numbers.
I have used the functionalities of OOPs to make this library feel like a predefined data type of C++ just like(int,float,etc)
I have overloded almost all the operators(Binary operators still remains), I also overloaded the >> and << to so give it the feel of a predefined datatype.
This project was a great learning on the side of OOPs.
